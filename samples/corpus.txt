Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language.
In particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
The result is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them.
The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.
Early attempts at natural language processing were rule-based systems that could answer simple questions.
Today, modern NLP employs deep learning algorithms to significantly improve text classification, translation, and other language-related tasks.

Text preprocessing is a critical step in NLP workflows. This typically involves tokenization, which is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens.
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a popular tokenization algorithm that iteratively replaces the most frequent pair of bytes (or characters) in a sequence with a single, unused byte.
It was originally developed as a compression algorithm but has found extensive use in NLP, particularly for subword tokenization in neural machine translation and language models like GPT and BERT.

The advantages of BPE include its ability to handle rare words and out-of-vocabulary words by decomposing them into subword units.
This makes it especially useful for languages with rich morphology or for technical domains with specialized vocabulary.
By learning merges from actual training data, BPE adapts to the specific patterns and frequencies of the language being processed.
