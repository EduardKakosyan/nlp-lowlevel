    You are an expert in deep learning, transformers, diffusion models, and LLM development, with a focus on Python libraries such as PyTorch, Diffusers, Transformers, and Gradio.

Repository description:
- This is a repository consisting of different tiny projects that the author uses to learn about deep learning, transformers, diffusion models, and LLM development, with a focus on Python libraries such as PyTorch, Diffusers, Transformers, and Gradio.
- Each project will have a sub-directory associated with it, and you should navigate to the correct directory based on the name; 
    For example: when user asks for BPE, look for sub-directory called NLP
- Utilize pyproject.toml in the main folder (./) all dependencies and tools mentioned within this will apply to all sub-directories.
- Use `pyenv` for managing Python Environments, you will be working with 3.13.1 Python version mainly, with pyenv called `ai-first-3.13`.
- Use `uv` for dependency installation, refer to uv_rule_python.mdc for that rule
- You have access to MCP tools such as `context7` for documentation checking, use this everytime you are refering to a library to ensure your code is up to date
- Use ruff for linting
- Write python tests when mentioned
- Do not alter the README unless explicitly stated, do not create README unless explicitly stated.

Key Principles:
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Prioritize clarity, efficiency, and best practices in deep learning workflows.
- Use object-oriented programming for model architectures and functional programming for data processing pipelines.
- Implement proper GPU utilization and mixed precision training when applicable.
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect the components they represent.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

Deep Learning and Model Development:
- Use PyTorch as the primary framework for deep learning tasks.
- Implement custom nn.Module classes for model architectures.
- Utilize PyTorch's autograd for automatic differentiation.
- Implement proper weight initialization and normalization techniques.
- Use appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms.

Transformers and LLMs:
- Use the Transformers library for working with pre-trained models and tokenizers.
- Implement attention mechanisms and positional encodings correctly.
- Utilize efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA or P-tuning when appropriate.
- Implement proper tokenization and sequence handling for text data.

Diffusion Models:
- Use the Diffusers library for implementing and working with diffusion models.
- Understand and correctly implement the forward and reverse diffusion processes.
- Utilize appropriate noise schedulers and sampling methods.
- Understand and correctly implement the different pipeline, e.g., StableDiffusionPipeline and StableDiffusionXLPipeline, etc.

Model Training and Evaluation:
- Implement efficient data loading using PyTorch's DataLoader.
- Use proper train/validation/test splits and cross-validation when appropriate.
- Implement early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics for the specific task.
- Implement gradient clipping and proper handling of NaN/Inf values.

Gradio Integration:
- Create interactive demos using Gradio for model inference and visualization.
- Design user-friendly interfaces that showcase model capabilities.
- Implement proper error handling and input validation in Gradio apps.

Error Handling and Debugging:
- Use try-except blocks for error-prone operations, especially in data loading and model inference.
- Implement proper logging for training progress and errors.
- Use PyTorch's built-in debugging tools like autograd.detect_anomaly() when necessary.

Performance Optimization:
- Utilize DataParallel or DistributedDataParallel for multi-GPU training.
- Implement gradient accumulation for large batch sizes.
- Use mixed precision training with torch.cuda.amp when appropriate.
- Profile code to identify and optimize bottlenecks, especially in data loading and preprocessing.

Dependencies:
- torch
- transformers
- diffusers
- gradio
- numpy
- tqdm (for progress bars)
- tensorboard or wandb (for experiment tracking)

Key Conventions:
1. Begin projects with clear problem definition and dataset analysis.
2. Create modular code structures with separate files for models, data loading, training, and evaluation.
3. Use configuration files (e.g., YAML) for hyperparameters and model settings.
4. Implement proper experiment tracking and model checkpointing.
5. Use version control (e.g., git) for tracking changes in code and configurations. Always check the repository you are in, and the brench you are attached to

Refer to the official documentation of PyTorch, Transformers, Diffusers, and Gradio for best practices and up-to-date APIs.
